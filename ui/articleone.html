<p>And there I was, lying on my bed, staring at the top and trying to catch with the pace of one of the revolving blades of my ceiling fan.</p>
<p>Half an hour to 1200AM, I confirmed as I made an eye contact with my phone&rsquo;s screen. It would be an end of a tiresome day and I still don&rsquo;t blame the practice sessions for the guard of honour which was to be performed on the coming Independence day. It wasn&rsquo;t that. Neither it was about tomorrow.</p>
<p>It was just a 10 digit number on a screen ready to be dialled. And, exactly half an hour from now it was going to lose its meaning.</p>
<p>A year back, the same day wasn&rsquo;t the same. A Birthday, of someone somewhere far away was being missed. And, with the whole three months of break and rehabilitation, I was still new to the process of keeping up with everyday.</p>
<p>It was uneasy, but maybe I could trust the different versions of me trying to fit a justification in a void of dilemma and confusion, reminding me of these happy facebook posts that I&rsquo;ve been reading on her timeline throughout the day.</p>
<p>We weren&rsquo;t friends on facebook. But maybe, that was something different altogether.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if I just skip it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maybe, it was for the best. And this is how the story should&rsquo;ve ended.<br />But on being carefully dissected, things didn&rsquo;t seem to be fair this way. So, I finally picked up the phone and dialled. A small ring was followed by a mechanised voice telling me that the number was busy. I tried it again, and could still hear a ring just before the message.</p>
<p>My number was blocked.</p>
<p>So, I took a deep breath, and started arranging my bed to sleep. I knew it would be a lot more difficult now. But, I was finally through with my state of confusion.<br />I rested my head on the pillow and wrapped myself with a newly dry cleaned blanket, tried to shut my eyes thinking that would help making things appear bit more darker than the room itself. I wasn&rsquo;t thinking anymore but I was clearly full of questions that would never seek their answers.<br />But it was then when I felt my phone vibrating. It was ringing. The number wasn&rsquo;t saved but I clearly remembered the order to put zeros and nines and ones and twos that would finally end up making her contact number .<br />It was 1158 at night.So, I immediately picked it up.</p>
<p>There was a small pause in the beginning.<br />But, it wasn&rsquo;t late enough to wish her a &ldquo;Happy Birthday.&rdquo;.</p>
